# Goal
* Create an script to asses the magnetorquer configuration feasibility of the spacecraft, while giving a fast spec on the spaceflight dynamics
# Motivation
* PocketCubes are a cube of a 5cm^3. This constrains the system in terms of weight and size. Therefore, the susbsytems PCBs configuration is done on a manner to achieve the success of the mission by giving as much space to the payload. However, there is no space left for an active  Attitude Determination and Control System. With this script we aim to have an initial guidance on the feasibility of the configuration
# Laboratory
* The actual manetorers coils are inside the ouuter solar cells PCB. With this, we create a multilayer PCB on each side of the cube. This gives us the oportunity to apply an active ADCS to a pocketcube without adding extra weight or multiple components.
# Research paper
* Under internal reviews and updates
